Review the current git diff. Then run deterministic checks before suggesting a commit:

1. Run `bash scripts/check.sh` from the repo root.
2. If checks fail, stop and summarize failures—do not suggest a commit.
3. Unless the user passed `--quick` or `--no-review`, launch a **fresh sub-agent** (or separate review pass) to review only the diff. The reviewer must not be the same context that wrote the changes. Focus on scope, correctness risks, and test coverage—not re-running the full implementation.
   - **Note:** Sub-agent review is **slow and costly** (extra model calls). Use it as the last automated gate before a human commit/merge, or skip with `--quick` while your team is still adopting the workflow.
4. If review or checks surface issues, summarize them for the user.
5. If all gates are green, draft a concise commit message from the **staged** diff (`git diff --cached`) and ask the user whether to commit.

Do not commit unless the user explicitly confirms.
